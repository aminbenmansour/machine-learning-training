# machine-learning-training

This repository was initiated thanks to the subtle learning interest in the field of machine learning. this repo will grow overtime in order to apply what i was able to learn in order to initiate my carrer in this field.

Each folder represents an experience, thus I will provide a brief description for each one.

##### 01-GDSC-HICS-MachineLearning-Hackathon
This notebook summarizes my trial in a competition on kaggle organized by GDSC ISI Ariana club, the purpose for me was not to be on the top of the leaderboard but making my first submission on kaggle instead as understanding the mechanism of this platform may boost significantly my carrer as a machine learning engineer. Despite this the accuracy of the model was quite fair with a value of 80% approximately.
